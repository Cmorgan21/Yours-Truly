### Features Left to Implement 
- Add a section where people can book a treatment from a diary

## Testing
 ### LightHouse Test
- One test that was conducted to test the website was the lighthouse test within the Chrome Developer Tools. 

- One thing that I struggled with was Peformance - as it stated that the 'Payload' is too large. I rectified this by compressing the images into a webp format instead of a PNG.
